THINGS TO DO:

-Figure out where to put ChangeReceiver button logic (stage or playerobj)

-Either add VPAD.OnClicks or add a delay to the button down due to the fact that Change Receiver is too fast

-Add DEFENSE logic
	-Find target
	-Lineup to target
	-Spy target
	-Man under
	-Man
	-Man over
	-Zone

-Add handoff & fakehandoff state
	-Send messages
	
-Implement FONT system which loads font spacing from a text file (could be part of SPRITE)

-Allow players to grapple a grappled player if the player is a ball holder, if so, ball holder needs to keep track of how many grapplers there are

-Add LEAP logic to catching

-Add stamina to PLAYER_INFO

-Change attributes to float?

-Fine tune throwing
	-Do not throw past endzone if player is standing at edge

-Fix field map gfx

-Code InfoBar drawing
	-OFFENSE info
	-DEFENSE info
	-Minimap

-Enable a memory system which allows the defense to store the plays used by 
the offense.  So if a play is first used, it is given a certain amount of memory
points.  When it is used again, the memory points increase a certain amount. 
When the play is not used, the memory points decrease by a certain amount.
The memory points will be used to determine how much awareness bonus the defense
receives.
