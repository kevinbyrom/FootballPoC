Here is a PoC of a football game I worked on *decades* ago.  Started as just a side project and turned into something I tinkered with, here and there, over the course of a couple of years.  It actually works and is fairly playable.

There are likely a bunch of files included here that didn't actually make it into the game.  Going to upload into Github anyways for historical / archival purposes.
